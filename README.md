# Executing work

Experimental examples of executing work using various implementations of Task and Task Executor, Job and Job Runner, Future, Promise.

## Future

A basic Future implementation with a Task doing some work. Supports cancellation.

## Future Reflect

Experimenting Future callbacks with reflection. Callbacks can have multiple signatures.

## Job

Running a Job which takes a Task and handles work with a Future.

## Promise

An async/await approach on executing work.

## Runner

A queue system to execute jobs supporting cancellation by ID and scaling up/down level of concurrency without restarting application.

## Simple Future

Just another approach on Futures.

## Task Executor

A basic tasks execution system.
